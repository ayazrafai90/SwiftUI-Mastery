# SwiftUI Exploration

Welcome to my SwiftUI Exploration repository! This is where I dive deep into SwiftUI, exploring everything from basic components to advanced techniques. It's both a learning resource for myself and a demonstration of my SwiftUI skills.

## Contents

- **Basics:** Core components like `Text`, `Image`, `Button`
- **Layouts:** Stacks, Grids, and custom layouts
- **State Management:** `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`
- **Advanced Topics:** Animations, Gestures, Custom Views
- **Projects:** Practical apps to apply SwiftUI concepts

## Purpose

This repository is designed for self-learning and to showcase my SwiftUI expertise. It reflects my ongoing journey to master SwiftUI, providing a reference for future projects and potential collaborations.
